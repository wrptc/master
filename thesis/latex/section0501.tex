\chapter{Summary and Future Work}
\section{Ssummary}
In this research, we use KNP tool to obtain event data as a list of verb-noun pairs:$v(c_1:n_1,n_2:n_2,...)$. we also use the output of KNP and KeyGraph to extract keywords. We have done an experiment to verify the feasibility of KeyGraph. After all the pre-work, we obtain maximal closures which can be used to build descriptive patterns by CLIQUE algorithm. We manual pick some candidates of descriptive patterns, that means maximal closure can be a possible way to extract all descriptive patterns. Limited by time and ability we didn't get the exactly descriptive pattern, but we have proposed a possible way of beam search to extract some descriptive patterns. It becomes a future work in my future research.
