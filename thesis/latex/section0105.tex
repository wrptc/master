\section{Overview}
In this paper, we have five parts, in Chapter 1, we have introduced our background and aim, and the basis of our research, the descriptive similarity.
\\
In Chapter 2, we will introduce some tools we used in our research, such as the precedent database, KNP system, and some import algorithm we need to use in our search, for example, KeyGraph and CLIQUES.
\\
Chapter 3 will contain some important definition of our search and the main algorithm based on our experiment. We will discuss the result and evaluation of the experiment in Chapter 4.
\\
Finally, in Chapter 5, we will summarize our research we have done and some the problem we have met during the experiment. We also have some idea to improve our research in the future.
