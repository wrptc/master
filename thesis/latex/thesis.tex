\begin{abstract}
Law plays a very important role in our humans' lives, at the present time, People always would like to use the law to protect their rights. Although we know old precedents is very helpful for new cases, there is also a fact that precedents are very long and very difficult to understand for our laymen. It is also not an easy work for specialists to find similar points among numbers of old precedents in a short time. In this paper, we proposed a method to extract similar parts of different precedents using the concept of descriptive patterns among multiple domains based on similarity classes of individual constants.

\section*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to express my gratitude to all those who helped me during the writing of this thesis. My deepest gratitude goes first and foremost to Professor Haraguchi, my supervisor, for his constant encouragement and guidance. He has walked me through all the stages of the writing of this thesis. Without his consistent and illuminating instruction, this thesis could not have reached its present form as a foreign student.\\
In addition, I also want to extend my gratitude to Professor Yoshioka and Dr. Okubo, who is always kind to me since I joined our laboratory. They alway give me sincere advice.\\
Finally, I would like to thank all the people who supported me in my university life so far.
