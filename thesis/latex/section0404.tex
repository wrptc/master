\section{Conclusion}
In Experiment 1, we verify the feasibility of KeyGraph, only with high KeyScore nouns, the connection between events won't be broken. Applying KeyGraph Algorithm can improve the efficiency and it is safe to use the result and disregard low KeyScore nouns.\\
In Experiment 2, we found that MFC by CLIQUE will work very slow if the input data become very large, as we know maximal clique problem is an NP complete problem. To be honest, CLIQUE may be the fastest way to find maximal cliques, and in the situation of document number less than 50, the runtime of algorithm is acceptable.\\
In Experiment 3, we apply our algorithm to 2 short Japanese stories. Although there are only four closures, we can still find the similarity classes between them. That means our algorithm can deal with very short documents.\\
In Experiment 4, we have done 3 different things. According to the whole result of these experiments, we can say, it is possible for our algorithm to find similar documents among multiple documents. And we can build the descriptive patterns using the result of our experiment. To build descriptive patterns, we can use the proposed method we have mentioned in the section of beam search. It may be a convenient algorithm to try in the future.
