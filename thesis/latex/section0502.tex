\section{Future Work}
In our research, we proposed a possible method to obtain possible descriptive patterns from maximal closures but limited by time and ability we didn't get all the exactly descriptive pattern. In the future research, we can continue the topic and find some feasible and efficient method to re-construct descriptive patterns. \\
As a fact, we can define each maximal closure a degree by the importance of nouns, and use a top-n clique algorithm to extract ranked maximal closures. This method may improve the effciency of the algorithm, and it is very helpful for our research.\\
In our research, we use 10 main cases from KNP tool, actually, there are over 20 kinds of cases that can be extracted. If we can extend the cases set, using some deep cases like location, agent, and others can also a powerful method to improve our research.\\
We have done some passive voice processing in the experiment, such as changing the case, the passive voice into an active voice. But there is another case that we did not consider like borrowing. In this case, the subject and goal of the action are exactly the opposite. If we forget to deal with this particular situation, we may completely wrong the nouns of these verbs, leading to further mistakes. Find out the grant relationship also can improve the result of our research.
